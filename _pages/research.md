**Stem cells** sculpt, shape, and form every tissue in our bodies. Likewise, the extracellular environment feeds back onto these cells to direct their function. This dynamic interplay is the central focus of our laboratory's research

The organ of our focus is the **respiratory system**. The respiratory tract is composed of an extensive network of branching airways that lead to small, sac-like structures called alveoli. These microscopic structures are thin and highly compliant to enable efficient gas exchange with the cardiovascular system; however, their delicate nature also makes them particularly vulnerable to damage. When injury occurs, the repair of the alveoli involves a finely tuned regenerative process. If this process is disrupted, it can result in chronic lung disease.

Repair of the alveolus requires coordinated interactions of all four cell compartments: epithelial, endothelial, immune, and **mesenchymal cells**. The primary cell compartment of focus of the Jones Lab is the mesenchyme. We examine how mesenchymal cell state and fate is specified and maintained in the respiratory system. We further examine how these cells contribute to lung homeostasis, repair, and disease through interactions with other cell lineages and the extracellular matrix. Our approach is to use cutting-edge tools such as single cell genomics, epigenomics, high-resolution microscopy, novel transgenic mouse models, 3D organoid in vitro models, and customized bioinformatics pipelines to pursue our research questions.

Our studies are rooted in our belief that a robust understanding of the endogenous repair and regenerative mechanisms within the respiratory system is <ins>essential knowledge</ins> to develop future therapies to better treat chronic lung diseases.
