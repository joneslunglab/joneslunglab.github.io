**Stem cells** sculpt, shape, and form every tissue in our bodies. Likewise, the extracellular environment feeds back onto these cells to direct their function. This harmony is the research focus of the laboratory.

The organ of our focus is the **respiratory system**. The respiratory track consists of a vast network of branching airways which empty into small sac-like tissue cavities called alveoli. These micro-sized tissue structures are extremely thin and compliant to facilitate gas exchange with the cardiovasculary system, but as a result, are sensitive to insult and injury. Once injured, the regenerative process to repair the alveolus is a delicate series of events which when go awry can lead to chronic lung disease.

Repair of the alveolus requires coordinated interactions of all four cell compartments: epithelial, endothelial, immune, and **mesenchymal cells**. The primary cell compartment of focus of the Jones Lab is the mesenchyme. We examine how mesenchymal cell state and fate is specified and maintained in the respiratory system. We further examine how these cells contribute to lung homeostasis, repair, and disease through interactions with other cell lineages and the extracellular matrix. Our approach is to use cutting-edge tools such as single cell genomics, epigenomics, high-resolution microscopy, novel transgenic mouse models, 3D organoid in vitro models, and customized bioinformatics pipelines to pursue our research questions. 

Our studies are rooted in our belief that a robust understanding of the endogenous repair and regenerative mechanisms within the respiratory system is <ins>essential knowledge</ins> to develop future therapies to better treat chronic lung diseases.
